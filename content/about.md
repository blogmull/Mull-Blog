## About Me

Hello! I’m Chris, a Linux Administrator by evening and a normal guy by day...

When I’m not working, I enjoy spending my time on a variety of hobbies, including:

- **Cooking**: One day I woke up and I noticed the lower quality food coming out of restaurants and stores. This set me on a mission to see how much cheaper I could make top quality food at home. My current standard for a resturant doing well is if they can make me food better than I can easily make it myself.
- **Handy Work**: I spend a lot of time on my computer and this causes me to enjoy my time doing mechanical , carpentry, welding, and so on. Anything I can do to keep my hands busy and feel that sense of accomplishment.
- **Gardening**: I am very much an aspiring gardener. I am trying to find a way in the current economy to grow things in an effective way that I will enjoy eating everyday. There is nothing better than homemade food with home grown ingredients. 
- **Video games**: I have put more time into video games than I ever would like to admit. I love getting lost in the endless fantasy worlds. I always come back to Runescape and Minecraft as staples. I also play anything from Escape from Tarkov to Wobbly life and anywhere in between.
- **Computers/Technology**: I love to tinker and see what crazy things I can come up. How many services and servers can I host from my home. What wires can I connect together to make something work. What types of things can a Raspberry Pi do that just facinate me. Or even what type of custom networking can I create for the fun of it.

I have the heart and mind of someone who just enjoys learning. This lends well to me equal enjoyment to share and pass on the information I have learned. 

Thanks for stopping by!
