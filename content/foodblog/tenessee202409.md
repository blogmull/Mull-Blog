## Pricing

I would say that the prices are fair for the quality. I probably have spent $20 to $25 dollars on my overall meal. I would say that is very worth it for what I received.

---

## Conclusion

I would preach this restaurant from the streets. It was a fantastic experience and they offer taste testing for their in house made alcoholic beverages per receipt of food. I did not partake of this but I have heard good reviews. I thought the presentation of the bartender was fantastic.

**Rating:** [9 out of 10]
