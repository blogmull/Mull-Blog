## Overview

**Item Name:** Professional XL Food Processor (1200 Peak Watts) NF701  
**Brand:** Ninja  
**Category:** [Electronics, Appliances, etc.]  
**Date of Purchase:** 2024-08  
**Usage Duration:** 1 year  

After looking over many reviews and liking other Ninja products I decided to purchase this food processor. This was intended to be a very decent workhorse in my kitchen.

## Design & Build Quality

The overall design of the Pro XL is very good. It is made of plastic that looks like stainless steel but is most certainly not. It was well thought out for how someone would want to use it.

## Features

### Key Feature 1

- **Safety:**  
  *Description: The device is built for safety with 3 different sensors to prevent it from starting unless every part of the container and lid are secured on the device.

### Key Feature 2

- **Accessories:**  
  *Description: Some big accessories that drew me in were the adjustable slicer size, the grater, dough blade, and the double stack cutting blades.

### Key Feature 3 (if applicable)

- **Power:**  
  *Description: The food processor is well advertised to have a 1300 watt peak motor. The advertising on this is plastered everywhere to show off the power compared to other machines. When you want to cut up a lot of veggies you want to do it with strength.

## Performance

In the first 2 months or so this thing performed flawlessly. It would grind an entire block of cheese like you would not believe. You could make dough bread in it with ease and many batches of cookies. Once you were finished you could easily throw it all in the dishwasher being dishwasher safe and not have to give a second thought to cleaning. After the two months or so we started to noticed it performing worse and worse. The motor seemed to start struggling when grating cheese or cutting carrots. The blade would just get stuck and stop spinning. At first I had thought I was over loading it and would do less and less taxing jobs until it just could not even do the basic tasks of a food processor.

That would have concerned me back then but I got it on sale for like $140 dollars down from I think $160 or $170 directly from Ninjas website. This meant I had a no questions asked warranty basically with normal use wear and tear. But I became not so happy to learn from reading their warranty that they consider warranty to replace any parts with used parts and immediately void the warranty once that was fulfilled. Basically you get a once and done "we did it we promise" So I did this and got a replacement base for which I had to pay for shipping to come to me.

Upon arrival with testing said device I could tell it was a "refurbished" model that they took from someone elses that stopped working and just send it to me once they confirmed it technically spun. I was not entirely mad overall just disappointed. They technically fulfilled their warranty agreement for the $140 dollar device I paid for. I think what got me annoyed the most was realizing that the company I enjoyed their products for (Ninja) could not be bothered to vet this product. This one product made me rethink purchasing any Ninja products going forward.

## Pricing

It was on sale, but based on the performance of it I would think it should have been $100 max.

---

## Conclusion

Do not buy this item. The price itself and the brand don't bother mas much as dropping 140 dollars to have it work at 20% effort after 2 months. If I would have gotten a year at maybe 80 or 90% usage we would have a different review here.
